The power of Docview comes from it's extensibility. As Docview is extensible,
it isn't limited to only a few number of formats like most documentation viewer.
With the help of extensions, it can show almost any type of documentation. So it
isn't required to wait for new releases to add support for a particular format,
anyone can write an extension adding support for that format. So you don't need
switch from one documentation viewer to another (e.g Terminal for man and info
pages, Devhelp for GNOME documentations), Docview is an all-in-one solution.
