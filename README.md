# Docview

Docview is an extensible documentation viewer which can show documentation in a variety of formats.

Docview doesn't support any formats out of the box. You have to use extensions to extend Docview. You can also write your own extension very easily (supported languages are C and C++).

## Notes

Docview is licensed under GNU GPLv3 (which can be found in the [LICENSE](blob/master/LICENSE) file), but the supporting library libdocview is licensed under GNU LGPLv3 (which can found at [src/libdocview/LICENSE](blob/master/src/libdocview/LICENSE)). All files under directory [src/libdocview](blob/master/src/libdocview) are part of libdocview and and license under LGPLv3. So feel free to link with libdocview dynamically.
